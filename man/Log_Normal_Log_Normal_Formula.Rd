Log_Normal_Log_Normal_Formula(
  concentration,
  shape_location,
  scale,
  shape_location_2,
  scale_2,
  weight
)
}
\arguments{
\item{concentration}{The vector of concentration values for a selected pesticide,
that has a species sensitivity distribution that fits a log normal log normal distribution,
to run the equation on.}

\item{shape_location}{The mu/shape value for the first log normal equation for the selected pesticide.
These can be found in the "Pesticide_Info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pesticides you will need to append them with their
respective distribution variables to the "Pesticide_Info" table.}

\item{scale}{The sigma/scale value for the first log normal equation for the selected pesticide.
These can be found in the "Pesticide_Info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pesticides you will need to append them with their
respective distribution variables to the "Pesticide_Info" table.}

\item{shape_location_2}{The mu/shape value for the second log normal equation for the selected pesticide.
These can be found in the "Pesticide_Info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pesticides you will need to append them with their
respective distribution variables to the "Pesticide_Info" table.}

\item{scale_2}{The sigma/scale value for the second log normal equation for the selected pesticide.
These can be found in the "Pesticide_Info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pesticides you will need to append them with their
respective distribution variables to the "Pesticide_Info" table.}

\item{weight}{The weight parameter for combining the two equations for the selected pesticide.
These can be found in the "Pesticide_Info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pesticides you will need to append them with their
respective distribution variables to the "Pesticide_Info" table.}
