\title{Burr Type III (Inverse Burr) Equation Formula}
\usage{
Burr_Type_III_Formula(concentration, scale, shape_location, shape_location_2)
}
\arguments{
\item{concentration}{The vector of concentration values for a selected pollutant,
that has a species sensitivity distribution that fits the Burr Type III distribution,
to run the equation on.}

\item{scale}{The Burr Type III scale/b value for the selected pollutant.
These can be found in the "pollutant_info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pollutants you will need to append them with their
respective distribution variables to the "pollutant_info" data frame.}

\item{shape_location}{The Burr Type III c/shape value for the selected pollutant.
These can be found in the "pollutant_info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pollutants you will need to append them
with their respective distribution variables to the "pollutant_info" table.}

\item{shape_location_2}{The Burr Type III k/shape value for the selected pollutant.
These can be found in the "pollutant_info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pollutants you will need to append them
with their respective distribution variables to the "pollutant_info" table.}
