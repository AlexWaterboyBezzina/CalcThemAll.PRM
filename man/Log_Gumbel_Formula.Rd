\usage{
Log_Gumbel_Formula(concentration, shape_location, scale)
}
\arguments{
\item{concentration}{The vector of concentration values for a selected pollution,
that has a species sensitivity distribution that fits a log gumbel distribution,
to run the equation on.}

\item{shape_location}{The mu/location value for the log gumbel equation for the selected pollution.
These can be found in the "pollution_info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pollutions you will need to append them with their
respective distribution variables to the "pollution_info" table.}

\item{scale}{The beta/scale value for the log gumbel equation for the selected pollution.
These can be found in the "pollution_info" data frame provided in this package.
If you are including other pollutions you will need to append them with their
respective distribution variables to the "pollution_info" table.}
