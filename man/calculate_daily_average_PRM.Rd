\usage{
calculate_daily_average_PRM(
  LOR_treated_data,
  include_PAF = FALSE,
  pesticide_info = CatchThemAll.PRM::pesticide_info
)
}
\arguments{
\item{LOR_treated_data}{A data set of LOR treated pesticide concentration values in
individual columns that match the pesticide names in the "pesticide_info" data frame.
This data set should also include a "Date", "Sampling Year" and "Site Name" column.}

\item{include_PAF}{If "TRUE" Percentage Affected Fraction values are included in
the output along with Daily PRM in a list format. These values can be useful for
plotting relative individual pesticide contribution to overall PRM,
however most will not need this so default is "FALSE".}

\item{pesticide_info}{The reference table which contains all relevant information for
calculations. It is recommended that the "pesticide_info" data set included in this
package be used and if you wish to include more pesticides you can appended
them with the relevant information to this table. If you are creating your own table you must
ensure that the pesticide name column is title "pesticide" and the relative LOR replacement
column is "relative_LOR" for the function to run.}
}
\value{
If include_PAF is "FALSE" returns a data frame of daily average PRM values
for each pesticide type for each sample. Wet season average calculations can be run
on the returned data. If include_PAF is "TRUE" returns a list with daily PRM values
in a data frame as the first object and a data frame of PAF values as the second object.
