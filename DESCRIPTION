Description: Contains functions which can be used to calculate Pesticide Risk Metric 
    values in aquatic environments from concentrations of multiple pesticides with known species sensitive 
    distributions (SSDs). Pesticides provided by this package have all be validated
    however if the user has their own pesticides with SSD values they can append them
    to the pesticide_info table to include them in estimates.
